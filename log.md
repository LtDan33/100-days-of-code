# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 29, 2018 
**Today's Progress**:
Going through tuturial on [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial02/) (illegal i know). Created models 
and db migrations. Basic view up and running. A lot of reading

**Thoughts:**
Never really dug 
into Python hard so its good to get back into it. After research Django seems like a easy oppininatted framework for my
backend CRUD service

### Day 1: May 30, 2018 
**Today's Progress**:
Updated the model. Added admins. Read through tutorial

**Thoughts:**
Life and work already got in the way, but tried to not have a "0 day". Did some light work but still put time in. I need
to do a little better tomorrow.
